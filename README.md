## 📖 About the Project

Skillcraft is a one-page responsive website that features a rich UI, clean navigation, and accessibility features like speech synthesis and dark mode toggle. The content introduces internship details, key learning features, and dummy links that simulate a full learning platform.

It’s an ideal showcase of frontend development skills — all built into a single index.html file.

## ✨ Features

   * 📱 Responsive Layout – Mobile-first design with adaptive navigation

   * 📂 Dropdown Navigation – Interactive submenus using vanilla JS

   * ⚡ Single HTML File – HTML, CSS, JS in one lightweight page

   * 🎯 No Frameworks – Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no external frameworks)
